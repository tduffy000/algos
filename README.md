# Algorithms

This repo contains work from the 4-course Stanford specialization on algorithms on Coursera, [located here](https://coursera.org/specializations/algorithms).

## Course 1
### Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms.
The primary topics of this course are Big-oh notation, sorting and searching, divide and conquer (master method, integer and matrix multiplication, closest pair), and randomized algorithms (QuickSort, contraction algorithm for min cuts).
